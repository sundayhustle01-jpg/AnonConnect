# **App Name**: AnonConnect

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Enable users to create profiles with basic information, like an optional username and profile picture. There is no authentication, but this feature sets a user ID in local storage to persist the illusion of having a profile between browser sessions.
- Start Random Chat: Implement a prominent 'Start Random Chat' button to initiate the pairing process with a random online user. There will not actually be multiple simultaneous users. All chats will simply be reflected back to the single user as a sort of chat bot.
- Real-Time Messaging Interface: Develop a clean, real-time messaging interface for seamless communication.
- Disconnect and Find New Chat: Add the functionality to disconnect from the current chat and automatically find a new chat partner, with intuitive UI elements.
- Profanity Filter: Automatically filter profanity from the messages sent using an AI-powered tool. This filter uses an LLM behind the scenes to reason about which words should be sanitized.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal (#222222) to create a modern, dark theme.
- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Accent color: Light grey (#B0B0B0) for text and secondary elements, providing contrast against the dark background.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, will be used for a modern, neutral look in both headings and body text.
- Use minimalistic, outline-style icons in electric blue to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with a clear separation between the chat interface, input fields, and action buttons.
- Incorporate subtle animations for message delivery and connection/disconnection events to enhance the user experience.
